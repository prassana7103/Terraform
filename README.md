### Write Terraform script to create a custom VPC and deploy two EC2 VMs on AWS using Terraform.

### The code should be broken into three different parts:

### Networking (define the VPC and all of its components).

### SSH-Key (dynamically create an SSH-key pair for connecting to VMs).

### EC2 (deploy a VM in the public subnet, and deploy another VM in a private subnet).

### NGINX should be accessed for all the internet.

### Automate Terraform Deployment with Jenkins Pipelines.
