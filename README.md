Write Terraform script to create a custom VPC and deploy two EC2 VMs on AWS using Terraform.

The code should be broken into three different parts:

Networking (define the VPC and all of its components)

SSH-Key (dynamically create an SSH-key pair for connecting to VMs)

EC2 (deploy a VM in the public subnet, and deploy another VM in a private subnet)

NGINX should be accessed for all the internet

Automate Terraform Deployment with Jenkins Pipelines
